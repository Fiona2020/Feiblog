I am a senior student in Biomedical Engineering at Tsinghua University. My research interests are mainly in biomedical imaging, neuroimaging, and biomedical data analysis. 

When I was a child, I was always curious about what was inside the human body. I asked myself: were there any king or queen living in my body to control my breathing, emotion, and fighting with diseases? Surely there were none, but when I grew up and was exposed to biomedical engineering during my undergraduate study, I realized that biomedical imaging is the best to know what is happening in our bodies. The imaging methods not only satisfy people’s interest but also help a lot with disease diagnosis and treatment. Inspired by the introduction of medical images in our courses, I determined to devote my intelligence and creativity to explore the issue on biomedical imaging and brain studies.
