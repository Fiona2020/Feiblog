abstract: We have developed a wireless epidural electrical stimulation system to control rat movements by providing stimulus with adjustable parameters on different epidural motor cortex areas. A hand-made multi-channel electrode array is implanted above the endocranium of the rat. A mini-size, light-weighted and multi-channel stimulus controller is carried on the ratâ€™s back, controlling by PC wirelessly. Different specific actions can be evoked in vivo experiments.
