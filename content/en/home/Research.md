## Neural mechanism between hearing damage and sight promotion 
 
 * Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University
 * Advisor: Prof. Hua Guo
 * 2019-09-16 to present
 
  Research:
  
 * Conduct a psychophysical experiment to measure brain changes in hearing-impaired patients using MRI (Ongoing)
 * Examine whether auditory neurons in the hearing impaired can be redirected to promote the vision.

## Human motion transparency perception and simulation interface

 * University of Wisconsin-Madison
 * Advisor: Prof. Xin Huang
 * 2019-08-01 to 2019-09-15

  
  Research:
  
  * Conducted a human psychophysics experiment to measure the perceived speeds of two overlapping visual stimuli that moved at different speeds.
  *	Developed a MATLAB program to simulate the responses of visual cortical neurons to multiple moving stimuli, taking into consideration of the tuning property of the mean response, trial-by-trial variability, the neural encoding rule, and noise distribution.

## A wireless portable epidural electrical stimulation system for rats

 * Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University
 * 201-07-21 to 2019-07-30
 * Advisor: Prof. Bo Hong
  
  Research:
  
  *	A hand-made four-channel electrode array implanted above the endocranium of a rat (impedance less than 1 Ohm). 
  * A mini-size (27mm * 13mm * 7mm), light-weight and multi-channel stimulus controller carried on a ratâ€™s back and controlled by PC wirelessly via Bluetooth.


## Eye-tracking algorithm research and implementation

  * Chioy Medical Company
  * 2019-07-01 to 2019-07-20
  * Advisor: Zhongwei Ma (Senior Engineer)

  Research:
  
 * Calibration of a binocular camera: output the parameter matrixes and calibrate the accuracy.
 * Location of pupils: dynamic recognition of eyes and calculation of the coordinates for the center of eyes.
 
## Emotion classification based on human EEG signals

  * Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tsinghua University
  * 2018-09-01 to 2019-06-30
  * Advisor: Prof. Sen Song
  
  Research:
  
  * Extracted spatial, temporal and frequency domain features from human EEG signals in response to videos, where trials video episodes were rated in four dimensions of emotion: valence, arousal, liking and dominance
  * Classified EEG signals using decision trees and machine learning, with best hit accuracy approaching 81%.
